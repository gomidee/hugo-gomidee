<p>I'm a Finance & Economics student. While I spend most of my days looking at boring graphs, statistics and reading balance sheets, I'm pretty cool.</p>
<p>I do like computers too... particularly enjoy the privacy and security side of computing. It's a hobby, I'm into weird stuff like Vim and Linux... (it's
secretly fun)</p>

<h2><strong>Fun Facts:</strong></h2>


<p>I'll keep this simple</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ I am based Down Under.</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ I love Shell scripting and I'm currently learning Go</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ I created this website because... why not? (if you don't have a website you're lame)</p>

<p>‚Ä¢ I love photography and wine üç∑</p>

<h3><strong>What should you expect from this website?</strong></h3>

<p>I'll basically talk about:</p>
<p>- Projects I'm working on</p>
<p>- Finance & Economics</p>
<p>- Personal opinions</p>
