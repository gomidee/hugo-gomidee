-> Note: This post is an introduction to a few concepts which I will still wire about.

It all began in 2020... From the first day of isolation, I could feel things changing: immense volatility in the markets, circuit breakers, panic shopping and a growing urge to find a flight back to your home country. Something big was happening and no one knew how to deal with it.

It became nearly impossible to interact with humans, you now required a middle man, to be 'connected', either a computer or a phone. **That's when it truly started**. In order to stay 'connected' to each other, most of our communications now happened through social platforms. Since I was on the finance space for a few years and involved in digital privacy communities, it was clear to me how this sudden shift in our communications could have great and long-lasting consequences.

Before I became interested on digital privacy, I was already big into finance. This allowed me to have great insights on the way tech companies that offer "free" services such as Google and Facebook operate. They're extremely interesting cases to analyse; these are multi-billion and trillion dollar companies who offer "free of charge" services for most of their users. Not only they have good margins and ever-growing profits but are also extremely resilient and aligned with the changes in the economy as they built platforms capable of empowering individuals, 'connecting people' and take pride in addressing their stakeholders. ****But...**** by understanding how corporations like Google and Facebook are able to show such great financial results, I found their "essence" to be extremely questionable.

<h3>How do they make money?</h3>

Google and Facebook are **advertising** companies. Therefore they make money selling ads... Sound simple right?

Well, it is simple to identify their business model but it's a little more complex to understand how they are able to be so effective. So, let's break it down.

<h4>The Three Pillars</h4>
To simplify, there are three major concepts behind the way these companies operate.

- <a href="aaa">The Infinite Loop</a>

<h2>What is the problem?</h2>

Understanding the three concepts above is key. If you're familiar with them you probably know the answer by now.

<h3>Knowledge is Power</h3>

To build effective AI engines, you need a **LOT** of data, specially if you're building a platform used by billions daily and serves targeted advertisement for each user.
