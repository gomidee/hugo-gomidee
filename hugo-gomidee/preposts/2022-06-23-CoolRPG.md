It's has been well over a year since a started tinkering around with Linux, and a few months since I fell in love with it.

Over this period, I started automating some processes by writing scripts, all of them written in BASH. Not only, it is efficient for automating processes but writing scripts has helped me a lot to better understand Linux and other programs that I use on my computer. What I love about it is that I can look at a script that I did months ago and build on top of it, with better configurations and syntax (I guess that applies to anything tho).

What I love about BASH scripting is that it's extremely easy to understand what is going on, even for beginners, and it has the same aspect that made me fall in love with Linux. 

It's extremely hackable and it feels like you're talking to the computer. Whatever you say, it will do... as long as you use 'magic' words. That's what makes Linux so great, if you want, you're in total control (you can also customise the heck out of it).

I was watching some YouTube videos on game development, something that I never really considered. Then I thought:

-- Well... I don't know C, Python, C++, Go, Rust yet. All I currently know and like is BASH so why not give it a shot?

Then I started using maths (in bash) to come up with with probabilities.

-- Since, we are already here, why not create something like Pokemon. You attack and it damages your opponent...

Then I did that... and it was pretty fun! 

So I added a character using cowsay, which made the little game much cooler!

So now I'm developing this CoolRPG. It will be a small game but with a good story line and easter eggs. It's going to be fun and my challenge is to make it with as little commands as possible.

For example:

Currently, in early stages I only have used these functions:

if (elif, else, bla bla bla)
sleep
echo
sed
cowsay (package, not really a command)
figlet (package, for printing cool text)

When I'm happy with it, I'll post an Alpha version on <a href="https://github.com/gomidee/">GitHub</a>. I'm excited for the future of CoolRPG, it's going to be a simple game... but it will be cool (as the name suggests).

That's it for the moment, as always feel free to email me about anything, also consider donating some XMR, that's the way to support me!!!
