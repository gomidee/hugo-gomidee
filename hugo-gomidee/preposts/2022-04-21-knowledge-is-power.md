The saying *"knowledge is power"* was popularised by Francis Bacon in his book *"Meditationes Sacrae"* from 1597, the original begin: *"knowledge itself is power"*. But it was around long before Bacon and its concept is omnipresent through various cultures. It is a simple to idea, it's easy to grasp and understand its meaning since it's considered to be a cliche in modern society.

 Indeed, it's not difficult to understand its meaning but things get complex very quickly when analysing real world examples and implications, particularly when it comes to technology. Two great works that deeply explore this concept in the case of technology and society are <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four>"1984" by George Orwell</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">"The Matrix" by The Wachowskis</a>.
